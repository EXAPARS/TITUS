TITUS is a framework for parallel task scheduling for large HPC applications. It has been tested up to 8k cores.
The main repository for TITUS can be found at https://github.com/exapars/TITUS

REQUIREMENTS :
	GPI2 1.3 or earlier : 
		Available from https://github.com/cc-hpc-itwm/GPI-2
		Make sure to install using MPI interoperability mode and IB support if available
		Set or export the GPI_HOME environment variable to the GPI installation directory.
	
	An up-to-date Libunwind installation is also required and may be either fetched from your distribution packages or built from sources using 
		git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/libunwind.git
	
INSTALL :
	Retrieve TITUS sources from https://github.com/exapars/TITUS
		git clone https://github.com/exapars/TITUS TITUS
	Set or export the TITUS_DLB_HOME environment variable
		export TITUS_DLB_HOME TITUS
	go to the TITUS install directory
		cd TITUS
	make
		make
	test -- Only with MPI-interoperable GPI install -- Feel free to test on any number of cores
		cd tests/bin
		mpirun -n4 ./DLB_Bench.bin


COMPONENTS :
	TITUS_DLB : A Dynamic Load Balancing library implementing a distributed Work-Stealing algorithm using GASPI.
	DVS : A Dynamic Victim Selector used to manage connectivity, victim selection decision for work-stealing and routing.
	Logger : A general purpose logger that collects and provides dynamic perfomance metrics for both runtime autotuning or traces & logs ouptut for post-mortem analysis
	SegmentMetadata : Higher level (than get & put) PGAS memory management for remote direct memory operations and buffered remote segments.
	DLB_Bench : A synthetic benchmark for TITUS_DLB.
		
An example use case can be found in tests/src/DLB_Bench. It is not a minimal working example.

UPCOMING WORK (no deadline) :
	- optimize strong scaling capability
	- Intra-node optimization for scaling up to 100k cores
	- Tasks dependencies for handling a wider variety of problem
