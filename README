TITUS is a framework for task-based programming and parallel task scheduling for large HPC applications.
The main repository for TITUS can be found at https://github.com/exapars/TITUS

REQUIREMENTS :
	GPI2 1.3 or earlier : available from https://github.com/cc-hpc-itwm/GPI-2
	Make sure to install using MPI interoperability mode and IB support if available
	set or export the GASPI_HOME environment variable.
	
	A recent Libunwind installation is also required and may be either fetched from your distribution packages or built from sources using 
		git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/libunwind.git
	
INSTALL :
	Retrieve TITUS sources from https://github.com/exapars/TITUS
		git clone https://github.com/exapars/TITUS TITUS
	Set or export the DLB_HOME environment variable
		export DLB_HOME TITUS
	go to the TITUS install directory and source the load_env script
		cd TITUS
	make
		make
	test
		mpirun -n4 TITUS/tests/bin/DLB_Bench.bin


COMPONENTS :
	DLB : A Dynamic Load Balancing library implementing a distributed Work-Stealing algorithm using GASPI.
	DVS : A Dynamic Victim Selector used to manage connectivity, victim selection decision for work-stealing and routing.
	Logger : A general purpose logger that collects and provides dynamic perfomance metrics for both runtime autotuning and later analysis
	SegmentMetadata : Higher level (than get & put) PGAS memory management for remote direct memory operations and buffered remote segments.

		
An example use case can be found in tests/src/DLB_Bench. It is not a minimal working example.
